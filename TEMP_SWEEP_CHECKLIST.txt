Temporary PPO Sweep Sanity Check
================================

1. Activate the desired Python environment (if applicable).

   ```bash
   source ~/.venvs/bss/bin/activate  # adjust to your environment
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository root.

   ```bash
   cd /workspace/BusinessStrategySimulator3
   ```

3. (Optional) Clear out any previous temporary sweep artifacts so the run produces
   fresh output directories.

   ```bash
   rm -rf WorkingFiles/Sweeps/ppo_slurm/*
   ```

4. Perform a dry run to confirm the SBATCH commands are generated correctly without
   submitting any jobs. Limit the run count to keep the check quick.

   ```bash
   python scripts/submit_slurm_ppo_sweep.py --dry-run --max-runs 2
   ```

5. Inspect the generated job scripts (if any) and the printed commands to verify the
   hyperparameters and rollout settings match the temporary mini grid.

6. When ready to exercise the full workflow once, submit the truncated sweep for
   real (still limited to two runs).

   ```bash
   python scripts/submit_slurm_ppo_sweep.py --max-runs 2
   ```

7. Confirm that the run directories and metadata were created as expected.

   ```bash
   ls WorkingFiles/Sweeps/ppo_slurm
   cat WorkingFiles/Sweeps/ppo_slurm/run_000/hyperparameters.json
   ```

8. After verifying the setup, delete this checklist.

   ```bash
   rm TEMP_SWEEP_CHECKLIST.txt
   ```
