## Requirements

This environment relies on PyTorch for training reinforcement learning agents.
To take advantage of Apple Silicon GPUs, install PyTorch ≥1.12 with MPS
support. The MPS backend is available in official releases and nightly builds:

```bash
pip install torch --pre --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu
```

If you already have a compatible version of PyTorch, the standard
`pip install torch` is sufficient.
